4. demonstrate the rollback and commit command for the above relation.

create table std1
(
regno varchar (20) primary key,
name  varchar (20),
class  varchar (20),
bdate date,
marks1 int,
marks2 int,
marks3 int
);


insert into std1 values('1','adil','BSC','12-jun-2004',50,70,90);
insert into std1 values('2','fayaz','BSC','13-jun-2003',80,80,50);
insert into std1 values('3','kaif','BED','14-jun-2001',60,60,80);
insert into std1 values('4','ahti','BSE','15-jun-2002',40,50,50);
insert into std1 values('5','ehab','BSC','16-jun-2001',70,40,70);

2. demonstrate the usage of following classes 

 a)where
    
select *from std where name='kaif';

 b) order by

select *from std1 order by class ASC;

 c) having

select regno,name,marks1 from std group by regno, name.marks1 having marks1 > 65;

 d) group by

select class from std group by class;


3. Demonstrate the usage of the following 

  a) sum

select sum (marks1) from std;

  b) avg

select avg (marks1) from std;

  c) count

select count(regno) from std;

 d) like

select *from std where 'class' like BSE;

 e) between

select *from std where 'marks1' between 80 and 90;

 f) max and min

select min(marks1) as lowest_marks from std;
select max(marks1) as highest_marks from std;
